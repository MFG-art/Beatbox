# ReactBox

ReactBox is an online drum machine built with React.js. React.js allows for a dynamic interface which responds quickly to user input while not compromising the performance of the audio engine. ReactBox is inspired by popular drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 and TR-909, both of which played a crucial role in the development of modern electronic music. As a fan of electronic music, I wanted to recreate this piece of cultural history. This project helped me develop my skills as a React programmer.

## Installation

The application is hosted on Heroku and can be found here:

```javascript
// add link here
```

## Usage

The user can interact with the drum sequencer by clicking the buttons in the beat matrix. Each drum sample (kick, clap, hat) has it's own row with sixteenth steps. These steps divide one measure of music into 16th notes, as previous drum machines did.
The pattern can be saved locally by clicking the save button.
